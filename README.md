## Project Details 

**1- Predicting Chickenpox cases**

**Objective:** This project cleaned, transformed, and applied various predictive models on the chickenpox dataset to predict an outbreak or simply future cases. Several candidate models were trained and tested, then two promising models were selected based on forecasting accuarcy metrics. Those two models, namely ARIMA and Holt Winters model, were tuned and tested. Finally, using forecasting accuracy metrics, ARIMA was selected as the best model

Candidate models: Holt-Winter model, ARIMA, TBATS, and STL + ETS 

**Goal:** These predictions allow hospitals and other healthcare institutions to devise effective strategies that can assist them in combating the impacts of the anticipated influx of cases, mitigating the significant clinical expenses caused by the disease.

**2- Customer Loyalty Prediction**

This project strived to provide insights into the specific predictors that the organization should optimize to improve customer loyalty. The dataset included various marketing-related predictors such as customer satisfaction, and negative publicity. etc. which were cleaned and transformed before feeding it to the Multiple Linear Regression model. 

Predictive accuracy was measured using 'Adjusted R-square ' and 'Mean Squared Error'.
Finally, repeated K-fold cross-validation was conducted to determine the performance of the model on new data.
